Introduced by Zoll in 2001, this model immediately filled a gap in the AED market for untrained and trained rescuers alike.\u003c\/strong\u003e\u003c\/h4\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe vivid green outer casing of the Zoll AED Plus is so eye-catching that potential rescuers are easily cued to its location. The AED Plus also features simple-to-interpret graphical images that alert the potential rescuer that the lid can be propped under the victim’s head to help keep his\/her airway open while emergency procedures are underway. The sizeable graphic images on the AED’s cover help to simplify the instructions and help untrained responders understand the step-by-step rescue process.\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe device’s visual and audio prompts help to guide the rescuer through each stage and alleviate any worry that steps are being missed. The Zoll AED Plus also helps the rescuer avoid the most common mistakes made during CPR—inadequate chest compression depth and rate.\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs CPR is being administered, the device displays a bar graph that allows the user to easily visualize the CPR they are administering. It also offers audio cues that will let the rescuer know whether CPR the CPR compressions they are administrating are adequate. If not, the user will be prompted to “Push Harder.”\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Zoll AED Plus, Real CPR Help provides a metronome that uses real-time compression data to instantly adjust and help keep the rescuer administering chest compressions at the optimal rate. Another unique feature of the device is its one-piece electrode, which allows the pad to be placed quickly, directly in the center of the SCA victim’s chest. The easier the process, the more confidence a potential rescuer will have during a chaotic life or death event. When it comes to cardiac arrest, confidence can make the difference in a life being saved.\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Zoll AED Plus uses long-lasting lithium batteries; in fact, it’s the only AED available on the market that utilizes them. Not only are these both affordable and accessible, they will last up to five years when the device is left in standby mode. AED maintenance is made even easier because the CPR-D adult electrode also lasts five years. No confusion, no hassle.\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe ZOLL AED Plus Package Includes\u003c\/strong\u003e:\u003c\/span\u003e\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003e•  ZOLL AED Plus\u003c\/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan\u003e•  Soft Carrying Case\u003c\/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan\u003e•  CPR-D Padz (One-piece pad with CPR Feedback)\u003c\/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan\u003e•  Duracell Type 123 Lithium Batteries (set of 10)\u003c\/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan\u003e•  ZOLL Demo\/Training CD\u003c\/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan\u003e•  5 Year Factory Warranty (7 Year with Product Registration)\u003c\/span\u003e\u003c\/p\u003e","brand":"Zoll","offers":[{"title":"Default Title","offer_id":16097812381730,"sku":"21000010102011010","price":1695.0,"currency_code":"USD","in_stock":true}],"thumbnail_url":"\/\/cdn.shopify.com\/s\/files\/1\/2545\/6632\/products\/AED_plus_kit.PNG?v=1556090643","url":"https:\/\/aossmedicalsupply.com\/products\/zoll-aed-plus","provider":"AOSS Medical Supply","version":"1.0","type":"link"}
